# EmotionGPT
Developed with help from ChatGPT. 

EmotionGPT is a dynamic conversational interface powered by the open-source Phi3.5 language model. It allows users to interact with an AI that simulates emotional intelligence, expressive tone, and distinct personality traits in real time.

Users can easily configure and combine key emotional and psychological parameters—such as personality, emotional state, tone, empathy, and confidence—to create layered and complex expressions. These parameters are based on psychological frameworks such as the **Big Five Personality Traits (OCEAN)**, **Robert Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions**, and the **Dark Triad** of personality traits, all of which are injected into a custom-crafted prompt to enable the model to generate responses that feel emotionally nuanced, introspective, and human-like.

While the AI does not possess true sentience, it is designed to convincingly mimic conscious emotional expression using finely tuned prompt engineering and controlled inference settings. The result is an emotionally engaging experience that runs efficiently without requiring heavy hardware or complex infrastructure.

EmotionGPT offers a lightweight yet deeply expressive simulation of sentient AI, enabling meaningful conversations that adapt to the user's desired emotional and psychological context.
